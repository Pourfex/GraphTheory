# README - GRAPH THEORY - DELFORGES ALEXIS
## Implementations
- Graph
	- Undirected Graph
	- Directed Graph
		- Adjency Matrix
		- Object oriented with nodes knowing succs and preds
- Algorithm
	- Directed Graph
		- BreathFirstSearch (BFS) - iterative version
		- DepthFirstSearch (DFS) - iterative and recursive version
		- Strong connexity - using a timer each time a node is visited
	

## Test

- Implementation have been tested with JUnit 4.
The test suite is : TestSuiteImplemStructure in src/test/
Launch tests with JUnit4 using the test suite or each test individually.
Tests have been written by Valentin Quiedeville, github username : Hamilcare.
Some other tests can be found in classes with main() functions, but they're not the supported tests.
One's can add other implementations test following the JUnit tests written.

- Algorithms have been tested within a main() class.
The main() function is in directedGraph class in src/AdjacencyList
BFS and DFS have been tested with 2 graphs, strongconnexity with 3 graphs. 
One's can add other graph with the response following the string schema given in main.
